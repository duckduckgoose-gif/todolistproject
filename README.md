## To-Do List 
First long term project I've made on Java, takes user input and saves it into an array. The array is then saved into a text file which is meant to be access later. This is very WIP and I'll get to this when I'm free

## Future Plans
So far I haven't been access the file with the arrays(tasks.txt) either because A. the code that saves it isn't working or B. It's unable to be loaded. Anyways the code for both needs to be rewritten entirely for it to work I believe. After that I do plan on making the code for adding/accessing/ and removing tasks to be a little more cleaner by compartmentalizing them into methods. In the future I plan on making it so that tasls require due dates to be entered upon task creation. The program will then send windows notifications , with it's frequency based on how close the computers date and time is close to the due date
